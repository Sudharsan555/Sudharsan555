# Hi there, I'm Sowmiyan S!

## About Me

I'm a tech-savvy engineering student obsessed with breaking down complex systems and rebuilding them cooler and cleaner. Currently knee-deep in ReactJS and UI/UX design—because looks **do** matter in code.  
I'm the founder of [**Bound by Code**](https://github.com/bound-by-code), a digital playground where I build, break, and share bleeding-edge tech with other code warriors. I also run [**Emeralz**](https://github.com/emeralz), a digital solutions squad for brands that want to look like they belong in 2030.

- 🌱 Currently learning: Advanced ReactJS + brutal UI/UX principles.  
- 💼 Founder of [**Bound by Code**](https://github.com/bound-by-code) & [**Emeralz**](https://github.com/emeralz).
